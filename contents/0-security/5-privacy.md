> "Only in a realm where we’re not being watched can we really test the limits of who we want to be. It’s really in the private realm where dissent, creativity and personal exploration lie.” - _Glenn Greenwald_

We have designed our system and service to protect your email privacy as much as possible. We do not scan your email to build up a profile of you. We do not serve you adverts.

However, true anonymity online is very difficult to achieve due to how easy it is to track information flow across the internet. 

The internet email protocol - as it stands today - was not designed with anonymity or privacy in mind. This being said, there are steps one can take to maximize one's privacy and minimize the chance of one's identity being revealed. 

### Insist on encryption when communicating with others

As explained in our [encryption guide](/docs/overview/email-encryption) true end-to-end email privacy can only be guaranteed when you and the 
person you are communicating with _both_ use email encryption.

Any un-encryped email in your mailbox will be readable by anybody who intercepts it en-route, legally or otherwise. 

Thus the more people you can encourage to either use 
Autonomail or an equivalent OpenPGP-supporting email system, the more you can protect the privacy of your communications.

### Access the internet through an anonymizing proxy

Normally when you access a website it can use your IP address to track down your geographical location and figure out which Internet Service Provider (ISP) knows who you really are. 

Anonymizing proxies such as [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) enable you to hide your geographical location whilst at the same time contribute computing power and bandwidth to a global network which enables the kind of free speech that a surveillance state threatens.

We recommend running [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/), a Tor-ified operating system that you can from a USB flash drive which ensures all your internet communciation goes through the Tor anonymising network. And it won't leave any traces of where you've been on your machine either.

### Use trusted software and services

Even though the Autonomail application is secure the platform on which it runs may not be. Without downloading the source code of an application, inspecting it and then compiling it yourself it is very difficult to be certain that what you're running is indeed secure. And even your [hardware may not be secure](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/12/glenn-greenwald-nsa-tampers-us-internet-routers-snowden).

At the very minimum you should consider running open source rather than closed source software. Open source means that the source cod can be viewed and compiled by anyone, giving you more insight into what an application does and more freedom of choice.
