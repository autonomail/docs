We use industry standard techniques to protect the contents of your email from being seen by anyone but you. Other email providers claim to protect your email in the same way, yet often [fail to do so](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hushmail) when it really matters. 

So we have designed our systems and our processes with the following principle in mind: **You do not need to trust us.**

* We aim to [encrypt](/docs/security/email-encryption) your emails before they even leave your device. Likewise for decrypting emails other people send you. 

* We never store your [password](/docs/security/passwords) on our server, yet we can authenticate you effectively to ensure that only you can access your account.

* Any [private data](/docs/security/private-data) you need to share between devices gets encrypted before being sent to our server. And we can't access this data even though it's on our server because only you hold the keys to it.

Please read our [privacy guide](/docs/security/privacy) for more information on how we protect your privacy.
