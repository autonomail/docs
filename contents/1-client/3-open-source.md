It is important that you have confidence in our system. To this end we have 
open sourced our client app so that you can inspect the source code for yourself:

[https://github.com/autonomail/autonomail](https://github.com/autonomail/autonomail)

This way you can build the app yourself from the source code if you don't trust the pre-built downloadable packages we provide. 

We welcome any and all bug reports and other feature suggestions for the app at the above URL.

### Technical notes

If you're a developer please feel free to fork our project and improve what we've made.

We aim to eventually open source more of our software stack so that you can host your own personal email service yourself.
