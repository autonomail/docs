Unlike normal webmail, you download it to your device once and then run it locally. This avoids many of the [security pitfalls](http://www.wired.com/2007/11/encrypted-e-mai/) associated with other webmail offerings.

Initially it will be available as a [Chrome browser app](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps), and eventually 
also as a standalone app for desktops, tablets and mobile.

Here are some of its key features:

* It saves a local copy of your [private data](/docs/security/private-data) on your device, enabling you to draft new emails even if you don't have an internet connection.
* It automatically encrypts all outgoing email messages if a public key is available for the recipient. If a public key is not available then the message is automatically digitally signed. Please see the [encryption guide](/docs/security/email-encryption) for more information.
* It is entirely [open source](/docs/client/open-source), so you can see how it works, build it yourself, and even contribute changes.
