We recognise that you may need to use Autonomail across more than 1 device. Eventually we aim to have mobile and tablet apps to complement our desktop offering.

### Seed 

We securely store your [private data](/docs/security/private-data) on our server in order to make it easy to setup a new device to your account and also to keep all your devices in sync with each other.

To register a new device you will need to know your Autonomail username and password and your _seed_ number. This number can be obtained from the _Settings_ page inside the Autonomail app on your existing device.

The seed number is unique to your account and is generated when you first register for Autonomail - it never gets sent to our server which is why we need you to input it. Once you have setup the Autonomail app on a new device you will not need your seed number to login again, your password will suffice.
