  ## Email protocol

  Autonomail communicates with other email servers using standard email protocols such as SMTP. However, the connection between the client 
  app running on the user's device and the Autonomail server does not operate according
  to traditional email protocols - [IMAP]() and [POP]() - as these were originally designed for older times when most internet access 
  happened over dial-up model connections. Autonomail instead build upon HTTP, the protocol used for web browsing. This 
  allows us to design a clean, fast protocol without any legacy elements and also make it easy for us to implement and test our protocol from a 
  software development point-of-view. Note that some other providers - such as Gmail - also work primarily with HTTP rather than traditional 
  email protocols so we are not really breaking new ground here.

  ### Technical details

  The Autonomail client app calls REST APIs exposed by the server for everything it needs to do, whether it managing emails or managing a user's 
  account. We may introduce the use of Websockets to make this communication even smoother.
